        Suppose in a group, 1 participant contributed 80 points, 1 participant contributed 40,
        and 1 participant contributed nothing. What would be the payoff of the participant who contributed 80 points?
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Solution: 92 points</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Explanation:</b> Total contribution from all participants was 80+40+0=120. Total earnings from the project were 120*1.8=216.
        Each participant got an equal share of the earnings, that is, 216/3=72. Hence, payoff for the participant who contributed 80 points
        was 100-80+72=92.
