You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant. Each of you will represent a firm.  Each firm manufactures one unit of the same product at no cost.
</p>
<p>
Each of you privately sets your price, anything from 0 to 100 points. The buyer in the market will always buy one unit of the product at the lower price. In case of a tie, the buyer will buy from one of you at random. Your profit is your price if your product is sold and zero otherwise.
