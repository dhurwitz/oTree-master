You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another player. Each of you will be given 30 points to start and be randomly assigned to be Participant A or Participant B. You will learn your role before making any decision.
</p>
<p>
Participant A will propose a contract to B. The contract includes two figures (in points) that must be chosen as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fixed Payment</strong>, which can be any number from -30 to 30</li>
    <li><strong>Return Share</strong>, which can be a multiple of 10%, that is 10%, 20%, … , 90%, or 100%</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that a negative fixed payment means that Participant B will have to pay the amount to Participant A.
</p>
<p>
Once Participant A has submitted the contract, Participant B must decide whether to accept or to reject it. If rejected, A will receive nothing while B will receive 10 points. If accepted, Participant B then chooses:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Effort Level</strong>, which can be any whole number from 1 to 10</li>
</ul>
<p>
Effort is costly only to Participant B and determines the total return, which will be apportioned according to the proposed return share. <i>The following table shows the relationship between B's effort, the cost of effort, and the resulting total return (in points):</i>
</p>
<table class=table>
    <tr>
        <th>Effort Level</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Effort Cost</th>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>18</td>
        <td>24</td>
        <td>32</td>
        <td>40</td>
        <td>50</td>
        <td>60</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Total Return</th>
        <td>14</td>
        <td>28</td>
        <td>42</td>
        <td>54</td>
        <td>70</td>
        <td>84</td>
        <td>98</td>
        <td>112</td>
        <td>126</td>
        <td>140</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
Given that the contract is accepted, Participant A will receive:<br />
<strong>(100% – [B’s Return Share in %]) × [Total Return] – [B’s Fixed Payment]</strong><br />
and Participant B will receive:<br />
<strong>[B's Return Share in %] × [Total Return] + [B's Fixed Payment] – [B's Effort Cost]</strong>
</p>
<p>
Your payoff from the study is the initial 30 points plus what you receive.
