In this study, you will be grouped randomly and anonymously with another 2 participants. One of you will be randomly assigned to be the buyer and the other 2 the sellers. Sellers and the buyer can trade for 3 periods. Prior to making any decision, you will learn your role, which will remain unchanged for 3 periods. 
</p>
<p>
At the beginning of each period, each of you will receive 50 points. The sellers will begin by privately choosing a <strong>price</strong> (from 0 to 50) and a <strong>quality grade</strong> for their products. Then the buyer will have the chance to purchase from one of the sellers at the price listed. Before purchase, the buyer will not observe grades. After purchase, the price and grade of the bought unit will be revealed to all. The grade can be <strong>high, medium, or low;</strong> higher grade costs more to produce and is worth more to the buyer. The table below shows production costs to the sellers and values to the buyer of different grades (in points):
</p>
<table class=table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Grade</th><th>High</th><th>Medium</th><th>Low</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Production Cost to Sellers</th>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Value to the Buyer</th>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>25</td>
        <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
The buyer can buy up to 1 unit of the commodity during a period and each seller can produce up to 1 unit in a period. <strong>Unsold units are not produced and hence incur no cost.</strong> 
</p>
<p>
The period payoff for the buyer is:<br />
<strong>
Buyer's period payoff = 50 + value of the grade purchased - seller's price
</strong></p>
<p>
The period payoff the sellers is:<br />
<strong>
Seller's period payoff = 50 + seller's price - cost of the grade produced
</strong></p>
<p>
One period will be randomly selected for all of you. Your corresponding period payoff, together with 10 points for participation fee, will be your final payoff from the study.
