Suppose that the buyer saw the following listed prices:<br />
<i>Price from Seller 1: 20 points</i><br/>
<i>Price from Seller 2: 20 points</i>
</p>
<p>
The buyer then bought 1 unit from seller 1. Having completed the purchase, the buyer realized that the commodity was of low grade.  What would be the period payoffs for the sellers and the buyer for this period?
