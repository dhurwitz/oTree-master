In each period,        participants could submit buy /sell orders that will determine a transaction price. At the end of each period, dividends are        distributed to participants according to their numbers of shares. Shares are not redeemed at the end of the study. Tradersâ€™        cash positions completely determine their payoffs from the asset market. The study is adapted from        <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/JECE.40.1.027-037">Bostian&Holt (2010).</a>     </p>    {% next_button %}{% endblock %}
